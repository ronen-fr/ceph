 * Reserving/freeing scrub resources at the replicas.
 *
 * When constructed - sends reservation requests to the acting_set.
 * A rejection triggers a "couldn't acquire the replicas' scrub resources"
 * event. All previous requests, whether already granted or not, are explicitly
 * released.
 *
 * Timeouts:
 *
 *  Slow-Secondary Warning:
 *  Once at least half of the replicas have accepted the reservation, we start
 *  reporting any secondary that takes too long (more than <conf> milliseconds
 *  after the previous response received) to respond to the reservation request.
 *  (Why? because we have encountered real-life situations where a specific OSD
 *  was systematically very slow (e.g. 5 seconds) to respond to the reservation
 *  requests, slowing the scrub process to a crawl).
 *
 *  Reservation Timeout:
 *  We limit the total time we wait for the replicas to respond to the
 *  reservation request. If we don't get all the responses (either Grant or
 *  Reject) within <conf> milliseconds, we give up and release all the
 *  reservations we have acquired so far.
 *  (Why? because we have encountered instances where a reservation request was
 *  lost - either due to a bug or due to a network issue.)
 *
 * A note re performance: I've measured a few container alternatives for
 * m_reserved_peers, with its specific usage pattern. Std::set is extremely
 * slow, as expected. flat_set is only slightly better. Surprisingly -
 * std::vector (with no sorting) is better than boost::small_vec. And for
 * std::vector: no need to pre-reserve.
